My COViD-19 data analysis

This is just amateur stuff, but if you find it useful, please use it.

The data is scraped from <a href="https://www.qld.gov.au/health/conditions/health-alerts/coronavirus-covid-19/current-status/current-status-and-contact-tracing-alerts">a Queensland Health website</a> which is updated multiple times throughout the day, but conclusively around 4pm. This wouldn't be necessary if they just provided JSON, ya know?

Producing qld.csv which is self explanatory.

Data is also scraped from <a href="https://www.qld.gov.au/health/conditions/health-alerts/coronavirus-covid-19/current-status/statistics">the stats page</a>, producing stats.csv.
